# Contribution Note üìù

You can simply create a pull request to add a new job position.

There are already a positions in the job table, so you can use them as a
template. There are a few preferences when you add a job posting:
- For the job link, it would be better if it is the direct link to
the job (the direct job post on the company page) rather than via a job board
like LinkedIn or Glassdoor.
- Keep in mind that the positions are sorted chronologically (newest first),
so make sure your newly added position is at the top of the job table. This would
make it easier for folks to keep track of the jobs and find out which one is the
latest job post.
- The "Notes" column should be used for important information such as info on bonus,
salary, citizenship requirement, etc.

It would be appreciated if you name your PR in this format `Add "<company> - <title>"`.
Someone will try to approve your PR as soon as possible.

One last thing is we do not add unpaid internships on this job table. So if you figure out
that any of the jobs is unpaid, please create a PR to remove it!

Thanks in advance for your contribution! You're the real rockstar!!! ü§©
